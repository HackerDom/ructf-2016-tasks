SITTING SILENT AND MOTIONLESS ON A HEAP OF STRAW AGAINST THE WALL, PIERRE SOMETIMES OPENED AND SOMETIMES CLOSED HIS EYES. BUT AS SOON AS HE CLOSED THEM HE SAW BEFORE HIM THE DREADFUL FACE OF THE FACTORY LAD — ESPECIALLY DREADFUL BECAUSE OF ITS SIMPLICITY — AND THE FACES OF THE MURDERERS, EVEN MORE DREADFUL BECAUSE OF THEIR DISQUIET. AND HE OPENED HIS EYES AGAIN AND STARED VACANTLY INTO THE DARKNESS AROUND HIM.
BESIDE HIM IN A STOOPING POSITION SAT A SMALL MAN OF WHOSE PRESENCE HE WAS FIRST MADE AWARE BY A STRONG SMELL OF PERSPIRATION WHICH CAME FROM HIM EVERY TIME HE MOVED. THIS MAN WAS DOING SOMETHING TO HIS LEGS IN THE DARKNESS, AND THOUGH PIERRE COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE HE FELT THAT THE MAN CONTINUALLY GLANCED AT HIM. ON GROWING USED TO THE DARKNESS PIERRE SAW THAT THE MAN WAS TAKING OFF HIS LEG BANDS, AND THE WAY HE DID IT AROUSED PIERRE'S INTEREST.
HAVING UNWOUND THE STRING THAT TIED THE BAND ON ONE LEG, HE CAREFULLY COILED IT UP AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK ON THE OTHER LEG, GLANCING UP AT PIERRE. WHILE ONE HAND HUNG UP THE FIRST STRING THE OTHER WAS ALREADY UNWINDING THE BAND ON THE SECOND LEG. IN THIS WAY, HAVING CAREFULLY REMOVED THE LEG BANDS BY DEFT CIRCULAR MOTIONS OF HIS ARM FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER UNINTERRUPTEDLY, THE MAN HUNG THE LEG BANDS UP ON SOME PEGS FIXED ABOVE HIS HEAD. THEN HE TOOK OUT A KNIFE, CUT SOMETHING, CLOSED THE KNIFE, PLACED IT UNDER THE HEAD OF HIS BED, AND, SEATING HIMSELF COMFORTABLY, CLASPED HIS ARMS ROUND HIS LIFTED KNEES AND FIXED HIS EYES ON PIERRE. THE LATTER WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOMETHING PLEASANT, COMFORTING, AND WELL-ROUNDED IN THESE DEFT MOVEMENTS, IN THE MAN'S WELL-ORDERED ARRANGEMENTS IN HIS CORNER, AND EVEN IN HIS VERY SMELL, AND HE LOOKED AT THE MAN WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM HIM.
